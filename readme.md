# Astro Blender Tools

Welcome to the `astro-blender-tools` repository! This project provides a set of tools specifically designed for Blender 4.1 to enhance your workflow. These tools include scripts for selecting non-deforming bones and saving poses as shape keys.

## Tools Included

### Select Non-Deforming Bones

**File:** `select_non_deform_bones.py`

**Description:** This script adds an option to the Select menu while in Edit Mode on an Armature to select all bones that have the Deform option unchecked. This can be particularly useful for rigging and animation tasks where non-deforming bones need to be managed separately.

**Usage:**
- Switch to Edit Mode on an Armature.
- Open the Select menu.
- Choose the "Select Non-Deforming Bones" option.

### Save Pose as Shape Key

**File:** `save_pose_as_shapekey.py`

**Description:** This script simplifies the process of generating shape keys based on an armature pose to a Target Mesh. It assigns the new shape key a name, making it easier to manage and apply in your projects. This option is available in the Blender Toolbar in the 3D View.

**Usage:**
- Pose your armature as desired.
- Select the target mesh.
- Access the "Pose as Shape Key" option in the Blender Toolbar in the 3D View.
